</div>

> [!WARNING]
> **🚧 EARLY ALPHA — ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
>
> This resource is fully functional for single doors and all core features listed below.
> However, it is still under active development and **not yet feature-complete**.
>
> **Known limitations in v1.0.0-alpha:**
> - ❌ **Double doors** — not working correctly yet (in progress)
> - ⚠️ API surface may change between alpha releases
> - ⚠️ Expect breaking changes before the stable 1.0.0 release
>
> Use in production at your own discretion. Bug reports and feedback welcome — that's exactly what alpha is for.

## 🔥 Why RDE Doors?

Most door scripts are static config files. You restart the server, you lose runtime changes. RDE Doors is different:

| Feature | Config-based scripts | RDE Doors |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime door creation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Persistent ownership | ❌ | ✅ Database-backed |
| Per-player access lists | ❌ | ✅ |
| Item-based access | ❌ | ✅ ox_inventory |
| Door groups | ❌ | ✅ |
| Decentralized logging | ❌ | ✅ Nostr |
| Admin triple verification | ❌ | ✅ ACE + ox_core + groups |
| Autolock timers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Bell & knock system | ❌ | ✅ |
| Price / buyable doors | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## 🎯 Features

### 🔒 Core Door System
- **Full CRUD** — Create, update, delete doors at runtime via events or admin commands
- **Database persistence** — All doors and groups survive server restarts (oxmysql)
- **Statebag sync** — Real-time door state broadcast to all players
- **Coordinate deduplication** — Prevents overlapping doors at the same position
- **Door validation** — Full server-side data validation on every operation

### 👤 Ownership & Access Control
- **Player ownership** — Doors can be owned per `charId`
- **Access lists** — Grant/revoke access to specific characters
- **Group-based auth** — Lock doors to ox_core groups (e.g. `police`, `mechanic`)
- **Item-based access** — Require an item from ox_inventory to open a door
- **Triple admin verification** — ACE permissions + ox_core groups + manual fallback
- **Buyable doors** — Set a price; players can purchase ownership in-game

### 🔔 Realism Features
- **Door bell** — Ring a doorbell; the owner gets notified via ox_lib
- **Knock** — Knock on a door; same notification system
- **Autolock** — Doors re-lock automatically after a configurable timeout
- **Max distance** — Per-door configurable interaction range

### 📊 Door Groups
- Create named groups containing multiple doors
- Lock/unlock an entire group at once
- Full group CRUD with persistent storage

### 🛡️ Admin Tools
- `/doorslist` — Print all doors to server console with validity status
- `/resyncdoors` — Force-resync all doors to all connected players
- `/cleandoors` — Scan and remove corrupted/invalid door entries from the DB
- `/doorinfo` — Get detailed info on the nearest door (within 10m)

### 📡 Nostr Logging
- Every significant action is broadcast to the Nostr network via `rde_nostr_log`
- Decentralized, permanent, uncensorable server logs
- See [Nostr Logging](#-nostr-logging-integration) section

## 📦 Dependencies

| Resource | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [oxmysql](https://github.com/communityox/oxmysql) | ✅ Required | Database layer |
| [ox_core](https://github.com/communityox/ox_core) | ✅ Required | Player/character framework |
| [ox_lib](https://github.com/communityox/ox_lib) | ✅ Required | Callbacks, commands, notifications |
| [ox_inventory](https://github.com/communityox/ox_inventory) | ✅ Required | Item-based door access |
| [rde_nostr_log](https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_nostr_log) | ⚠️ Optional | Decentralized logging — highly recommended |

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_doors.git
```

### 2. Add to `server.cfg`

```cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_core
ensure ox_lib
ensure ox_inventory
ensure rde_nostr_log   # optional but recommended
ensure rde_doors
```

> **Order matters.** `rde_doors` must start **after** all its dependencies.

### 3. Start / Restart

```
start rde_doors
```

The database tables are created automatically on first start. No manual SQL import needed.

### 4. Verify

Check your server console — you should see:

```
[RDE Doors] ✅ Ready with X doors (X valid) and X groups
[RDE Doors] 📜 Server-side script ready
```

## 📋 Admin Commands

All commands require the `rde.doors.admin` ACE permission or an admin ox_core group.

| Command | Description |

| `/doorslist` | Lists all doors in the server console with validity info |
| `/resyncdoors` | Reloads all doors from DB and resyncs to every player |

---

## 📡 Nostr Logging Integration

RDE Doors integrates natively with [rde_nostr_log](https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_nostr_log) — the world's first decentralized FiveM logging system.

If `rde_nostr_log` is not running, logging is silently skipped — **no errors, no crashes**.

### Events Logged

| Event | Nostr Message |
|---|---|
| Player loaded | `👤 Player loaded: Name \| UserID: X \| CharID: X` |
| Player dropped | `👋 Player dropped: Name \| Reason: X` |
| Door locked/unlocked | `🔒 Door Locked/Unlocked \| Name \| By: Player` |
| Door created | `✅ Door created: Name \| By: Player` |
| Door updated | `🔄 Door updated: Name \| By: Player` |
| Door deleted | `🗑️ Door deleted: ID \| By: Player` |
| Price set | `💰 Price set: Name → $X \| By: Player` |
| Door renamed | `✏️ Door renamed: ID → NewName \| By: Player` |
| Access granted/revoked | `🔑 Access granted/revoked \| Name \| By: Player` |
| Door purchased | `💳 Door purchased: Name \| By: Player (CharID: X)` |
| Bell rung | `🔔 Bell rung at: Name \| By: Player` |
| Knock | `👊 Knock at: Name \| By: Player` |
| Group created | `✅ Group created: Name \| By: Player` |
| Group renamed | `✏️ Group renamed \| By: Player` |
| Group deleted | `🗑️ Group deleted \| By: Player` |
| Door added to group | `➕ Door added to group \| By: Player` |
| Door removed from group | `➖ Door removed from group \| By: Player` |

### Quick Setup

```bash
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_nostr_log.git
cd rde_nostr_log
yarn install
```

```cfg
# server.cfg — ensure before rde_doors
ensure rde_nostr_log
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### `attempt to index a number value (local 'player')` on `ox:playerLoaded`

This was a bug in older versions. The correct `ox:playerLoaded` server signature is:

```lua
-- CORRECT (v6.0.0+):
AddEventHandler('ox:playerLoaded', function(playerId, userId, charId)
    -- playerId = server source ID (number)
    -- userId   = user ID (number)
    -- charId   = character ID (number)
end)

-- WRONG (caused the crash):
AddEventHandler('ox:playerLoaded', function(source, player)
    player.charId  -- ❌ player is actually userId (a number), not a table!
end)
```

**Already fixed in this version.** If you see this error, make sure you're on the latest commit.

---

### `No such export log in resource rde_nostr_log`

The correct export name is `postLog`, not `log`:

```lua
-- CORRECT:
exports['rde_nostr_log']:postLog('Your message', {{'event', 'event_type'}})

-- WRONG:
exports['rde_nostr_log']:log(...)
```

Already fixed in v6.0.0+.

---

### Doors not syncing to players after restart

Run `/resyncdoors` in the server console. If doors still don't appear, check that `oxmysql` is fully started before `rde_doors` — adjust your `server.cfg` order.

---

### `MySQL not available` on startup

Ensure `oxmysql` is started before `rde_doors` in `server.cfg`:

```cfg
ensure oxmysql       # must come first
ensure rde_doors
```

---

### Door created but invisible in-game

The model must exist client-side. Double-check the `model` string matches an actual prop name (`prop_*` or a streamed custom model). Use `/doorinfo` while standing near the expected position to confirm the door was saved.

---

### Access always denied despite being admin

Verify your ACE setup:

```cfg
add_ace group.admin rde.doors.admin allow
add_principal identifier.steam:YOURSTEAMHEX group.admin
```

Or add your group to `Config.AdminSystem.oxGroups` in `config.lua`.
